## Inspiration
In many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries such as Australia, 
over-nutrition and obesity are significant concerns. Diets high in processed foods, sugars, unhealthy fats, 
and low in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains contribute to this imbalance.
While over-nutrition is a problem in many regions, malnutrition persists as a significant issue, particularly in developing countries. This includes under-nutrition (not consuming enough nutrients), as well as micronutrient deficiencies such as iron, iodine, and vitamin A deficiencies.
Poor nutrition is associated with a range of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, certain cancers, and micronutrient deficiencies leading to conditions like anemia, goiter, and night blindness.

So what can modern tech do to help addressing this global nutrition challenge? What is the main reason behind nutrition imbalance? By our survey and observation, one major reason is that people do not have sufficient knowledge about the nutrition in their daily food!

It will clearly not possible for everyone to be an expert in nutrient and keep track on their daily meal, so the Rooftop Coders
decide to lend a helping hand by utilizing modern AI technology, computer vision along with knowledge in daily nutrition intake, we
developed NutriFlex aiming to help users get to know their food, understanding what nutrients are in their food and getting advices on 
daily nutrient intake.

## What is NutriFlex
NutriFlex is a webApp serving as a nutrient expert, it gives suggestions on your daily nutrient intake amount and also helps you keep tracking on the nutrient you eat.
User just need to enter their physical information such as age, gender, weight and diet preference, and taking a picture on 
their food, NutriFlex will detect the food type in the food photo and calculate the nutrient in it. Every meal's nutrition data will be stored in the app and by utilizing AI, 
NutriFlex will let user know whether their nutrient intake is within a healthy range.

## How NutriFlex achieve it
For the UI/UX we used Figma to design our app.
